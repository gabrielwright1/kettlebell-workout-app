		<!-- 
    Kettlebell Workout App:

    Problems to solve: 
    - While exercising outdoors at the cottage the WIFI signal is too weak to allow me to access Google Stopwatch. 
    Therefore, an offline app needed to be created to help me complete my workout regimen.
    - Oftentimes, when using just the Google Stopwatch, I forget which set I am on, or how many of each exercise I have completed. 
    Therefore, the app needs to keep track of each set count for each exercise so that I can make sure that I'm getting the appropriate quantity in the workout.
    - At the end of each workout, it would be nice to get a summary of how many reps/sets were completed for the workout.
    - The app needs to be simple enough to use and navigate during a workout, and automate much of the unnecessary preamble to get started.
s 
    Requirements:
    - Display the time in the middle of the screen
    - Change the color of the screen during workout vs. rest periods for different workouts
    - Allow users to reset the counter and timer
    - Allow users to learn about the workout types using a modal
